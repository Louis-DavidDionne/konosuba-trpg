!PROTOTYPE RELEASE! Many things are missing. Coming up is a bucket-load of polish for the sheets, automation of rolls/stats/calculations/everything else and filled compendia (as well as many many tweaks to more technical things).

Installation (For now):
Simply download the latest release, extract the folder contents and drop the folder "konosuba-trpg" into FoundryVTT/data/systems. If the folder is named anything else than "konosuba-trpg" you will NOT be able to select the system in Foundry (Don't rename it c;).

Not currently looking for feedback as the majority of features aren't currently implemented and many things will be added/fixed prior to first full release. (I will gladly accept and encourage all feedback once the project is out of Prototype releases though c: Easiest way to communicate it to me currently will be by the Konosuba TRPG subreddit discord group)
